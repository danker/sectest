A skeleton Grails app modeled after the example project defined in the Grails Spring Security User Guide: http://burtbeckwith.github.com/grails-spring-security-core/docs/manual/guide/single.html

A few changes/additions were made to the tutorial application:
 - Domain name changes:  The default classes of 'User' and 'Role' would possibly conflict with some database reserved words.  They were changed to 'Person' and 'SecurityRole'
 - Secure Channels: Forced logins to occur over HTTPS
 - Added Persistent Login (cookies) saved to the database
 - Added password encryption with salt
